                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup
                    Language. It is used to design web
                    pages using markup language. HTML
                    is the combination of Hypertext and
                    Markup language. Hypertext defines
                    the link between the web pages.

                    Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred
                    to as CSS, is a simply designed language
                    intended to simplify the process of
                    making web pages presentable. CSS allows
                    you to apply styles to web pages.

                    The term PHP is an acronym for PHP:
                    Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a
                    server-side scripting language
                    designed specifically for web
                    development. PHP can be easily
                    embedded in HTML files.
